Vision

 A review website focused on cinematography. My goal is to make this site into one that favors the user’s input in every way possible, and keep an open line of communication for any and all feedback. 

Success Criteria

The website will need to be user-friendly and keep the users’ information safe. The website will need to provide quality reviews, with a focus on user reviews over critic reviews.  Users should be able to post their own reviews as well as comment on others’ reviews inciting discussion.
